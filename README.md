# AIBoMGen Project

This repository aggregates research Proof of Concepts related to **AI Bills of Materials (AIBOMs)**.  
It contains the stable AIBoMGen v1 platform and points to ongoing work for the next generation (v2).

## AIBoMGen v1

**Release:** `v1.0-stable`  
_Branch:_ [`aibomgen-v1/main`](https://github.com/idlab-discover/AIBoMGen/tree/aibomgen-v1/main)

The original AIBoMGen platform is a proof-of-concept system that generates AIBOMs while training AI models.  
It includes:  
- **[AIBoMGen Frontend](./aibomgen-frontend/README.md)**: A Next.js-based web application for interacting with the AIBoMGen platform.
- **[AIBoMGen Platform](./aibomgen-platform/README.md)**: The backend system for distributed AI training and AIBoM generation.

Legacy branches for different experimental versions are preserved under `aibomgen-v1/...`.

## AIBoMGen v2 (Current Work)

**AIBoMGen v2** — Next-generation system for generating AIBOMs covering the **full AI lifecycle**, integrated with Kubeflow ML Metadata.  
_Branch:_ [`aibomgen-v2/main`](https://github.com/idlab-discover/AIBoMGen/tree/aibomgen-v2/main)
